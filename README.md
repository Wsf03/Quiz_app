# Quiz_App

Created a quiz app in which I have added 5 questions with 4 options. After completing 5 questions, your result will display.
This is my #task2, as I am intern in @Sync Intern as a frontend web developer. I am seriously enojying this internship, as i am learning more things and by building such small projects, I am gaining more skils day by day.
